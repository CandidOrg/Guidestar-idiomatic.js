### Build & Deployment Process

Projects should always attempt to include some generic means by which source can be linted, tested and compressed in preparation for production use. For this task, [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) by Ben Alman is second to none and has officially replaced the "kits/" directory of this repo.

### Test Facility

Projects _must_ include some form of unit, reference, implementation or functional testing. Use case demos DO NOT QUALIFY as "tests". The following is a list of test frameworks, none of which are endorsed more than the other.

 * [QUnit](http://github.com/jquery/qunit)
 * [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)
 * [Vows](https://github.com/cloudhead/vows)
 * [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha)
 * [Hiro](http://hirojs.com/)
 * [JsTestDriver](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/)
 * [Buster.js](http://busterjs.org/)
 * [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/)
