# Idiomatic JavaScript Style Guide
## Principles of Writing Consistent, Idiomatic JavaScript

This is a living document and new ideas for improving the code around us are always welcome. Contribute: fork, clone, branch, commit, push, pull request.

All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.

The following list outlines the practices that I use in all code that I am the original author of; contributions to projects that I have created should follow these guidelines.

I do not intend to impose my style preferences on other people's code or projects; if an existing common style exists, it should be respected.

> ### "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec."
>_Idan_ _Gazit_
