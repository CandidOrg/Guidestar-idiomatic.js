##Whitespace
  - Never mix spaces and tabs.
  - When beginning a project, before you write any code, choose between soft indents (spaces) or real tabs, consider this **law**.
    - For readability, I always recommend setting your editor's indent size to two characters &mdash; this means two spaces or two spaces representing a real tab.
    - **GuideStar uses soft indents of two spaces**
  - If your editor supports it, always work with the "show invisibles" setting turned on. The benefits of this practice are:
    - Enforced consistency
    - Eliminating end of line whitespace
    - Eliminating blank line whitespace
    - Commits and diffs that are easier to read
  - Use [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) when possible.  It supports most IDEs and handles most whitespace settings.
